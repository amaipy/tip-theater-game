## The Interactive Project

Interactivity is commonly recognized as an important feature of contemporary games and media, but its roles in older modes of communication and its potential as an exploratory tool are not widely understood. Under the direction of Chris Reyns-Chikuma (MLCS), Astrid Ensslin (MLCS-HC) and Walter Davis (EASIA), sponsored by SSHRC and KIAS, and in collaboration with the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Education, and several Departments, the Interactive Project (TIP) proposes that interactivity should be both a subject of investigation and a means of generating new understanding. During a 5-week (Sept.27 -Oct.29, 2021) cross-disciplinary event, the project will bring scholars, creators, students, and the general public together to explore the complex ways in which interactivity has articulated human experience throughout our history and continues to do so today. 

## Theater

Nowadays, theatre in the West is most often watched and listened to as a form of entertainment. However, there are other ways to experience theatre that are more engaging and interactive. 

At this station, YOU can become the actor. Break the fourth wall; step up on the stand and become someone else in the mirror next to a beautifully dressed “Judy”; and listen to the recording to [hear](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/tips-interactive-project/home/the-5-senses#h.fl7bihphlbrq) the 5 clues that will help you deduce where to find the first puzzle piece.
